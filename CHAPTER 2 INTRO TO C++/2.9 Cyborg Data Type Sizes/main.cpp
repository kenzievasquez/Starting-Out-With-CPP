/* 2.9 Cyborg Data Type Sizes  (pg.81)
You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer. In order to
accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes the following data
types use: char, int, float, and double. You do not have any manuals, so you canâ€™t
look this information up. Write a C++ program that will determine the amount of
memory used by these types and display the information on the screen.
